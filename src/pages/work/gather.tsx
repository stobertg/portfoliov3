                    Gather&apos;s fundamental purpose is to foster a collaborative learning environment, where knowledge is gained 
                    and shared through a foundational curriculum, coupled with individual experiences. Gather&apos;s belief is that 
                    real change does not follow clich√© templates controlled by bureaucratic flexors, but instead by empowering 
                    grassroot leaders who understand the nuanced and complex nature of their own communities. This unconventional 
                    approach creates realistic, small changes that compound into substantial growth within their communities.
